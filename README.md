# Hi, Iâ€™m DHAYANANTH EðŸ‘‹
**AI/ML â€¢ Frontend & Full-Stack Web Developer â€¢ Curious problem-solver**

Iâ€™m a final-year engineering student building at the intersection of **web development** and **machine learning/AI**. I love turning ideas into usable products â€” from responsive frontends to data-driven models â€” and I learn best by doing: shipping features, iterating from feedback, and improving through failures. Currently working full-time at **Webocrats** and actively exploring ML applications.

## What I do
- Build scalable, user-focused web applications using modern frontend frameworks and pragmatic backend patterns.  
- Explore and prototype ML/AI solutions, especially applications that connect imaging/data with actionable insights.  
- Work across the stack: I enjoy UI polish, performance tuning, and creating reproducible data workflows.
